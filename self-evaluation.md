# Self - Evaluation

- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
* I feel confident with what we learned so far, but overwhelmed when I looked up array calls and saw how many there are XD.

- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
* Just reinforcement.

- What questions do you have about Arrays?
* Just the question of learning more and how we will use them in the future, which I'll find out soon enough :).

- Commit your work.
